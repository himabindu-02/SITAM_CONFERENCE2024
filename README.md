As a significant achievement in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) Department, I developed a conference website for SITAM-2024, designed to effectively showcase event details and institutional excellence. The website features a user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless navigation and accessibility for participants, speakers, and attendees.

Built with modern web technologies, the platform enhances engagement by providing comprehensive event information, schedules, speaker profiles, and registration details. It serves as a centralized hub for the conference, facilitating smooth communication and interaction among organizers and participants.

This project demonstrates my technical expertise in web development and content management as well as my commitment to enhancing academic visibility and supporting institutional initiatives.
